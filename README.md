# Mano Manikandan's Repository

This is a repository for Web Programming Year 2. I will be using this to make a small blog about my car while applying practices throughout the teaching of this course.

# First Commit (Version 1.1)

In this commit I will be setting up the basic fundamentals of my project. I have created a new file main.html and wrote some basic HTML which I will build on throughout the rest of this course.

I then add some basic css elements following my favourite design principles of simplicity and softness. More will be added in my next commit as I add more practices learnt from the future lectures.
P.S - V1.11 was released to remove some css I realised did not have an effect on anything on my page.
